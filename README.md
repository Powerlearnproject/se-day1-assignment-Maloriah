#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer:
Software Enginnering is the structrued and systematic process of designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintening software products.
It is therefore important in the technology industry as it helps in:
1.Solving real world problems by enabling the systematic development of creaticve and innovative solutions that solve complex problems.
2.Bridge gaps and help in making everyday proceses seamless by enabling creation of reliable, efficient and scalable software products that can handle a vast amount of data.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer:
1. Development of programming languages - The development of a set of instructions or command written as a code to help machines excecute tasks.
2. Introduction of structred programming - The development of formal methods used to design and develop software products.
3. Emergance of agile software development methodology - The emergence of a software development approach that was more flexible. It involved breaking down a big and complex project into smaller more manageable and easy steps/stages.
   
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:
1. Requirement Gathering - The research done to identify what the user needs are and what requirements the software should have to adress these needs.
2. Design - Creating a detailed design and architecture of the software.
3. Development - Writing the actual code to build up the design.
4. Testing - Carrying out various tests to ensure the software meets the system requirements and meets the user specific needs while maintaining a good speed and maintaining functionality.
5. Deployment - Releasing the built software to the user.
6. Maintenance - adressing and resolving issues and regularly updating the system.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:
1. Waterfall methodology - This is a linear approach whereby there are different stages/phases that need to follow each other in such a way that the second phase can only be started once the first phase is finished.
Going back to the previous stage or phase is not allowed.
2. Agile methodology - This is an iterative and incremental approach whereby 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer:
1. Software Developer - Writes the code to build the software product.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - Perfoms tests to ensure the software meets the required quality standards and functional requirements.
3. Project Manager - Oversees and manages the people and activities involved in the entire software development process. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer:
1.Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- Software that provides software developers with the tools for writing, compiling and debugging their code e.g Visual studio code.

2.Version Control Systems (VCS)- Software tools that aid in tracking and managing changes made to source code e.g Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer:
1. Changing Requirements - The user requirements may change during the development cycle which may lead to missed deadlines, lack of man power and insufficient resources. Adopt agile methodology which makes it easier to adapt to changes in requirements.
2. Time Limitations - Unrealistic deadlines which may lead to developer demotivation and poor code quality due to limited reviews.  Break down the project into smaller chunks and arrange the tasks based on their priority. Requrarly assess and set realistic deadlines and timelines.
3. Collaboration - Ineffective communication between team numbers which may also lead to delayed timelines and poor product quality. Provide a platfrom and create a schedule where the team can frequently interact and give their feedback.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer:
1. Unit Testing - This involves testing the functionality of each individual module.
2. Intergration testing - This is the testing done to ensure the modules work well together.
3. User acceptance testing - Testing if the system meets the user requirements.
4. System testing - Testing the entire system to ensure it is functional and seamless.
5. Perfomance testing - Testing the speed and scalabiity of the system.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer:

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer:
